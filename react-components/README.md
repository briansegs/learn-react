# React Components

## Project - Authorization Form

[Authorization Form](https://github.com/briansegs/learn-react/tree/main/react-components/project_authorization-form)

- A client asked me to hide their websiteâ€™s contact page behind a password form. In this project, I accomplished this by using a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.
