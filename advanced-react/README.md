# ADVANCED JSX

## Curly Braces in JSX

[Curly Braces in JSX](https://github.com/briansegs/learn-react/tree/main/advanced-react/curly-braces-in-jsx)

- Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn’t add numbers - it reads them as text, just like HTML.

- I need a way to write code that says, “Even though I am located in between JSX tags, treat me like ordinary JavaScript and not like JSX.”

- I can do this by wrapping my code in curly braces.

## Variables in JSX

[Variables in JSX](https://github.com/briansegs/learn-react/tree/main/advanced-react/variables-in-jsx)

- When I inject JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in my file.

- That means that I can access variables while inside of a JSX expression, even if those variables were declared on the outside.
